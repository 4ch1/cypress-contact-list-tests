# Components of the App That Can Be Tested and Their Hierarchy of Importance

## Form Validation (High Priority)
- **Importance**: Ensures that user inputs meet specified criteria, preventing invalid data from being submitted and ensuring data integrity.
- **Components to Test**: Required fields, input formats (e.g., email, date, phone number), boundary values (e.g., maximum length).

## API Functionality (High Priority)
- **Importance**: Ensures that the backend processes and data handling work correctly, enabling the application to function as intended.
- **Components to Test**: API endpoints, request and response handling, data persistence, error handling.

## Error Messages (Medium Priority)
- **Importance**: Provides feedback to users when they make mistakes or when system issues occur, improving user experience and guiding correct actions.
- **Components to Test**: Display and accuracy of error messages, appropriate handling of invalid inputs, user-friendly messages.

## UI Components (Medium Priority)
- **Importance**: Ensures the usability and accessibility of the application, making it easy for users to interact with the system.
- **Components to Test**: Presence and functionality of UI elements, layout consistency, responsive design.

## Navigation (Medium Priority)
- **Importance**: Ensures smooth transitions between different parts of the application, providing a seamless user experience.
- **Components to Test**: Functionality of navigation buttons and links, correct page transitions, back and forward navigation.

## Database Interactions (Low Priority)
- **Importance**: Ensures that data is correctly saved, updated, and retrieved, maintaining data consistency and integrity.
- **Components to Test**: Data storage and retrieval processes, data validation, consistency across the application.

# Approach to Testing Each Area

## Form Validation

### Approach
- **Manual Testing**: Enter various combinations of valid and invalid data to ensure that the form correctly validates inputs and displays appropriate error messages.
- **Automated Testing**: Use automated testing tools to simulate user inputs and validate form behavior under different conditions (e.g., test required fields, correct input formats, boundary values).

### Test Cases
- Verify that required fields cannot be left empty.
- Check that email fields accept only valid email formats.
- Ensure that phone numbers and dates are in the correct format.

## API Functionality

### Approach
- **Manual Testing**: Use tools like Postman to manually send API requests and verify responses.
- **Automated Testing**: Implement automated tests that send various requests to the API and check responses, data persistence, and error handling.

### Test Cases
- Ensure that valid data is correctly processed and saved.
- Verify that invalid data results in appropriate error responses.
- Check that the API returns the correct data for various queries.

## Error Messages

### Approach
- **Manual Testing**: Trigger different types of errors by providing invalid inputs or causing system issues and observe the error messages displayed.
- **Automated Testing**: Automate tests to deliberately cause errors and verify that the correct messages are shown.

### Test Cases
- Verify that errors such as missing required fields or invalid email formats display the correct error messages.
- Ensure that system errors (e.g., API failures) provide user-friendly messages.

## UI Components

### Approach
- **Manual Testing**: Inspect the UI for completeness, layout consistency, and responsiveness. Interact with each UI element to ensure it functions correctly.
- **Automated Testing**: Use automated UI testing tools to simulate user interactions and verify that UI components behave as expected.

### Test Cases
- Check that all input fields, buttons, and labels are present and correctly labeled.
- Ensure that the layout is consistent across different devices and screen sizes.

## Navigation

### Approach
- **Manual Testing**: Navigate through the application manually to ensure that all links and buttons work correctly and lead to the expected pages.
- **Automated Testing**: Automate tests to simulate user navigation and verify that the correct pages are loaded.

### Test Cases
- Verify that the Submit button adds a contact and redirects to the Contact List page.
- Ensure that the Cancel button returns the user to the Contact List page without adding a contact.
- Check that the Logout button logs the user out and redirects to the login page.

## Database Interactions

### Approach
- **Manual Testing**: Perform operations in the application and manually query the database to verify data correctness.
- **Automated Testing**: Use automated tests to perform database operations and check the state of the database before and after these operations.

### Test Cases
- Verify that adding a contact correctly saves the data in the database.
- Ensure that data retrieval operations return the correct information.
- Check for data consistency after updates and deletions.



# Test Case 1.1: Successful Login (Happy Path)

## Preconditions
- User is already registered and has a valid email and password.

## Steps
1. **Navigate to the login page.**
    - Open a web browser.
    - Enter the URL of the login page in the address bar.
    - Press Enter.

2. **Enter a valid email in the email field.**
    - Locate the email input field on the login page.
    - Enter the valid registered email (e.g., `user@example.com`).

3. **Enter a valid password in the password field.**
    - Locate the password input field on the login page.
    - Enter the valid registered password.

4. **Click the "Submit" button.**
    - Locate the "Submit" button on the login page.
    - Click on the "Submit" button.

## Expected Result
- User is successfully logged in and redirected to the dashboard.
    - The user sees the dashboard page.
    - The URL in the browser address bar changes to the dashboard URL.
    - There is no error message displayed.

## Example Code for Automated Test (Using Selenium in Python)
```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC

# Set up the WebDriver (example using Chrome)
driver = webdriver.Chrome()

try:
    # Navigate to the login page
    driver.get("http://example.com/login")

    # Enter a valid email
    email_field = driver.find_element(By.ID, "email")
    email_field.send_keys("user@example.com")

    # Enter a valid password
    password_field = driver.find_element(By.ID, "password")
    password_field.send_keys("validpassword")

    # Click the "Submit" button
    submit_button = driver.find_element(By.ID, "submit")
    submit_button.click()

    # Wait for the dashboard page to load
    WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
        EC.url_contains("/dashboard")
    )

    # Verify the URL contains the dashboard path
    assert "/dashboard" in driver.current_url

    # Optionally, verify that some element on the dashboard page is present
    dashboard_element = driver.find_element(By.ID, "dashboard-element-id")
    assert dashboard_element.is_displayed()

finally:
    # Close the WebDriver
    driver.quit()
